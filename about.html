                    <p>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is an action-adventure game played from a third-person view.
                        Compared to FromSoftware's own Souls series, the game features fewer role-playing elements, lacking character creation
                         and the ability to level up a variety of stats, as well as having no multiplayer elements.
                        It does, however, include gear upgrading, a skill tree, and limited ability customization. 
                        Rather than attacking to whittle an enemy's health points, 
                        combat in Sekiro revolves around using a katana to attack their posture and balance instead, 
                        which eventually leads to an opening that allows for a single killing blow.
                        The game also features stealth elements, allowing players to immediately eliminate some enemies if they can get in range undetected.
                        In addition, the player character has the ability to use various tools to assist with combat and exploration, such as a grappling hook.
                        If the player character dies, they have the option of being revived on the spot if they have 
                        resurrection power, which is restored by defeating enemies, instead of respawning at earlier checkpoints.</p>
                    <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">Plot</h4>
                    <p>In 17th century Japan following the Sengoku period, warlord Isshin Ashina staged a coup and seized control of the land of Ashina.[1] During this time, a nameless orphan is adopted by the wandering shinobi named Ukonzaemon Usui,
                        known to many as "Owl", who named the boy "Wolf" and trained him in the ways of the shinobi.
                        Two decades later, Ashina is on the brink of collapse due to the now elderly Isshin falling ill and the Interior Ministry, 
                        a group set on unifying Japan, steadily closing in. Desperate to save his clan, Isshin's adoptive grandson Genichiro seeks the immortal "Divine Heir" Kuro in hopes of using "Dragon Heritage" 
                        in his blood to create an immortal army. Wolf, now a full-fledged shinobi and Kuro's personal bodyguard, fights him but loses the duel along with his left arm while Genichiro takes the boy.

                        Having received Kuro's blood, Wolf survives and is brought to an abandoned temple to recuperate by a Sculptor, a former shinobi known as Sekijo who now carves Buddha statues. Armed with a Shinobi Prosthetic,
                        Wolf assaults Ashina Castle and confronts Genichiro again, defeating him, though the latter survives as he drank the "Rejuvenating Waters", a man-made replication of the Dragon Heritage. As Wolf rescues Kuro,
                        the two are given the opportunity to flee Ashina forever, though Kuro instead decides to stay and perform the "Immortal Severance" ritual, which would remove his Dragon Heritage and prevent anybody else from fighting over him to obtain immortality. 
                        Wolf reluctantly agrees to help and sets out to collect the necessary materials for the ritual, including a special sword that can kill immortals known as the Mortal Blade which is safeguarded by the immortal "Child of the Rejuvenating Waters", 
                        the only survivor from an experiment with the Rejuvenating Waters. 
                        During his quest, Wolf crosses paths with Isshin Ashina, who gives him a new name: "Sekiro", the "one-armed wolf".
                        After collecting all the components for the ritual, Sekiro is confronted by Owl, who was thought dead years prior. Owl reveals he also seeks the Dragon Heritage, and orders Sekiro to renounce his loyalty to Kuro. If Sekiro sides with Owl, 
                        he is forced to fight Isshin's doctor, Emma, and Isshin himself. Upon defeating them, Sekiro proceeds to betray Owl while Kuro realizes he has been corrupted by bloodlust, resulting in the "Shura" ending.
                         If Kuro is chosen, Sekiro fights and kills Owl. He then uses the gathered items to enter the Divine Realm to collect the final component: the Divine Dragon's tears. Upon returning to Ashina, Sekiro discovers Isshin has succumbed to his illness and that the castle is under attack by the Interior Ministry. 
                         Being informed by Emma that Kuro has fled, Sekiro finds him under attack by Genichiro, wielding a second Mortal Blade. Genichiro then challenges Sekiro one last time, only to be defeated once again. Realizing Ashina is lost, 
                         Genichiro sacrifices himself by using the Mortal Blade to revive Isshin in his prime so he might restore the clan. 
                        Although he disagrees with Genichiro's methods, Isshin honors his grandson's wish and fights Sekiro.</p>
                    <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3">Development</h4>
                    <p>Development of Sekiro began in late 2015, following the completion of Bloodborne's downloadable content, The Old Hunters.[10] 
                        The game was revealed via a teaser trailer at The Game Awards 2017 in December, showing the tagline "Shadows Die Twice".[11] The game's full title was revealed to be Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice during Microsoft's press conference at E3 2018. It was directed 
                        by Hidetaka Miyazaki of the Japanese development studio FromSoftware, best known for creating the Souls series and Bloodborne.[12] The game was published by Activision worldwide, with FromSoftware self-publishing it in Japan, 
                        and Cube Game publishing in the Asia-Pacific region.[13][14] Sekiro's soundtrack was composed by Yuka Kitamura,[15] with some contributions from Noriyuki Asakura. The game was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One on 22 March 2019.[16] 
                        A collectors edition of the game was also released the same day, and included a steelbook case, a figurine of the protagonist, an art book, a physical map of the game's world, a download code for the soundtrack, and in-game coin replicas.[16]
                         A port for Stadia was released in late 2020.[17]

                        Sekiro draws inspiration from the Tenchu series of stealth-action games that were partially developed and published by FromSoftware.[18] The team initially considered developing the game as a sequel to Tenchu, but as that series had already been shaped by several different studios before they obtained the rights to it, 
                        they instead opted to take the project in a different direction.
                        [10] Miyazaki intended for the combat changes to capture the feel of "swords clashing",
                         with fighters trying to create an opening to deliver the fatal strike.[3] He and the team also created the game to be a fully single-player experience, as they believed multiplayer to have limitations they wanted to avoid.[6] The word "Sekiro" (隻狼) is a contraction of "Sekiwan no ōkami" (隻腕の狼), which translates as "one-armed wolf.
                         "[19] Additionally, the subtitle "Shadows Die Twice" was originally only meant to be used as a slogan for the teaser trailer until Activision requested it to be kept for the final name.
                         [3][20] Despite the game taking place during the Sengoku period of real world Japanese history, there are no historical people or locations featured in the game.[21] On October 31, 2020, a free "game of the year" update was released that added new content to the game, such as new cosmetics for Wolf and a boss rush game mode.</p>
                    <h4 id="scrollspyHeading4">Reception</h4>
                    <p>According to review aggregator Metacritic, Sekiro received "universal acclaim" for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions, and "generally favorable" reviews for the Windows version.
                        [23][24][25] Many critics praised the game's combat for departing from the typical style of FromSoftware's other similar games. In a review for Destructoid, Chris Carter described open combat as "akin to a waltz" and praised the variety of ways the combat could be approached, writing that players had more choices than in Dark Souls or Bloodborne.[26] 
                        Brandin Tyrell from IGN praised the game's focus on "split-second swordsmanship", and despite the fact that "to any Souls veteran, Sekiro's timing-based lock-on combat of strikes and slashes is familiar", the game's "sense of safety" caused the combat to feel "refreshing and new".[33] PC Gamer journalist Tom Senior called the combat "beautiful" and praised the posture system, writing that "instead of chipping 
                        down health bars until the enemy keels over, you overwhelm their posture bar with strikes and perfect
                         parries until an opening appears, and then finish with a deathblow".[38] He stated that the system takes "the catharsis" of beating a great boss and "focuses all that emotion into one split second". In a review for website GameSpot, Tamoor Hussain wrote that the game "rewrites the rules of engagement", stating that, while previous FromSoftware
                         games demanded quick decision-making, Sekiro "pushes these demands further" than ever before. Reviewers also praised the resurrection mechanic, with Carter calling it "genius", and the stealth options, which gave the player freedom without descending into frustration.</p>
                    <h4 id="scrollspyHeading5">Sales</h4>
                    <p>On release day, Sekiro drew over 108,000 concurrent players on Steam, the highest for a new game launched during January–March 2019, and the third highest of any Japanese game in the platform's history, behind only Monster Hunter: World and Dark Souls III.[43][44] Later in March, it had reached over 125,000 concurrent players on Steam, making it one of the most played games on the platform at the time.
                         In its debut week, Sekiro topped both the UK and EMEAA (Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia) charts, surpassing Tom Clancy's The Division 2.[46][47][48] In Japan, the game debuted at first with 157,548 retail copies sold in its opening weekend.[49] Within ten days of its release, over two million copies were sold worldwide, which rose to over five million by July 2020.</p>
